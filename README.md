# Road_Accident_Analysis
# Excited to share my first project using Power BI! 🚀 I built a Road Accident Analysis Dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable insights for improved road safety.

Key findings from the dashboard include:

Accident Severity by Casualties: 🚨 This analysis delves into factors contributing to accident severity, including the number and extent of casualties. By understanding these dynamics, stakeholders can identify areas for targeted interventions to mitigate severity and improve overall safety outcomes.

Casualty Insights by Road Type & Vehicle Type: 🛣️🚗 The findings highlight the importance of allocating resources to high-risk areas like urban roads and prioritizing safety measures for vulnerable road users like cyclists.

Temporal & Environmental Trends: 📅🌦️ While the two-year dataset limits conclusive trends, the dashboard reveals a potential increase in casualties during April and May, possibly due to seasonal factors. Additionally, the analysis identifies a higher risk of casualties in daylight hours, prompting further investigation into driver behavior during these times.

Visualizing Location & Conditions: 🗺️ The dashboard leverages maps to pinpoint accident locations and allows users to filter by weather conditions and road surface, providing a comprehensive view of potential risk factors.
